	Oil Used	Sunflower, corn, canola	Palmolein, palm—linked to heart risks

	Indian Lay’s = Double the saturated fat, palm oil, and riskier additives. The chips may taste great—but your heart won’t thank you!

Cerelac: 

	Added Sugar per Serving	0g (no added sugar)	~3g added sugar per serving
	Regulatory Compliance	Strict EU/UK standards; no added sugar allowed in baby cereals	Compliant with Indian FSSAI but allows added sugar
	While Cerelac in Europe contains zero added sugar, Indian Cerelac hides nearly 3 grams per serving — creating a sugary trap for babies. The early sugar addiction risk in India is real.
